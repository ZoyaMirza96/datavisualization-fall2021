# __Pitch For Final Project:__

## *Why Are Millennials Taking a Step Back from Social Media in This Digital Age?*
### A close analysis of recent social media habits being adopted by digital platform consumers, especially those in their twenties and thirties. Social media users have stated feeling stressed, anxious, self-conscious and even depressed after spending an excessive amount of time scrolling through these applications –– a sentiment, that has, no doubt, had an adverse impact on their mental health.   

### A report published by the Royal Society for Public Health in 2017 cites Instagram to be the application that has had the worst impact on mental health, most notably on young women and how they assess their body image. Four years later, these adverse side effects have only multiplied in number.

### My piece will be based on data collected from a set of social media consumers whose age ranges from 20-30, with a particular focus paid on those who work demanding corporate jobs with long hours. I will question them on their social media consumption habits from five years ago versus right now, that is, 2016 - 2021, and how those have changed, if at all. My data set will present a global assessment, focused on cooperate professionals employed in the east coast, but also from cities such as London, Melbourne and Lahore.

### __Clarity and Accuracy:__
### a)	5/5: 
### - It is evident from the very onset of the piece that the reporter is speaking about vaccine inequity and the disparity in access to healthcare between the white population versus communities of color.
### -	Yes; though the exact figures and levels of disproportionate vaccine access wasn’t apparent, the thesis of the piece was transparently displayed. 
### b)
